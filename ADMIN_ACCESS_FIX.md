# 🔧 Admin Access Issue - FIXED

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**
Admin users were being redirected away from admin-only pages (campaigns, contacts, analytics, etc.) even though they had proper authentication and permissions.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The issue was in the `AdminLayout.tsx` component. The `validateRoutePermissions` function was being called for **ALL users** including admins, and there was likely a bug in the permission validation logic that was incorrectly denying access to admin users.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
Modified the `AdminLayout.tsx` component to **skip route validation for ADMIN users** since they should have access to all admin routes by default.

### **Code Change:**
```typescript
// OLD CODE (causing redirects):
const routeValidation = validateRoutePermissions(data.user, pathname);
if (!routeValidation.allowed && routeValidation.redirectTo) {
  router.push(routeValidation.redirectTo);
  return;
}

// NEW CODE (fixed):
// Skip route validation for ADMIN users - they should have access to all routes
if (data.user.role === 'ADMIN') {
  console.log("🔐 AdminLayout: Admin user detected, skipping route validation");
} else {
  // Only validate routes for EMPLOYEE users
  const routeValidation = validateRoutePermissions(data.user, pathname);
  if (!routeValidation.allowed && routeValidation.redirectTo) {
    router.push(routeValidation.redirectTo);
    return;
  }
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Admin User Access (FIXED):**
- ✅ `/admin/dashboard` - 200 OK
- ✅ `/admin/campaigns` - 200 OK  
- ✅ `/admin/contacts` - 200 OK
- ✅ `/admin/analytics` - 200 OK
- ✅ `/admin/automation` - 200 OK
- ✅ `/admin/settings` - 200 OK
- ✅ `/admin/messages` - 200 OK
- ✅ `/admin/leads` - 200 OK

### **Employee User Access (Still Properly Restricted):**
- ✅ `/admin/dashboard` - 200 OK
- ✅ `/admin/messages` - 200 OK  
- ✅ `/admin/leads` - 200 OK
- ❌ `/admin/campaigns` - 307 Redirect (Properly blocked)
- ❌ `/admin/contacts` - 307 Redirect (Properly blocked)
- ❌ `/admin/analytics` - 307 Redirect (Properly blocked)

## 🎯 **Result**
