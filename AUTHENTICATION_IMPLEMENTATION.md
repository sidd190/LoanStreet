# Authentication and Role Management Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive JWT-based authentication and role-based access control system for the loan agent platform.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. JWT-Based Authentication System
- **Enhanced authentication library** (`lib/auth.ts`)
  - Secure JWT token generation and verification
  - Password hashing with bcryptjs (12 salt rounds)
  - Password strength validation
  - Role-based permissions system
  - User authentication and management functions

- **Authentication middleware** (`lib/middleware/auth.ts`)
  - Token validation middleware for API routes
  - Permission-based access control
  - Role-based authorization
  - Optional authentication support

- **Authentication API endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login with JWT tokens
  - `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh mechanism
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` - Secure logout with cookie clearing
  - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset initiation
  - `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset completion
  - `POST /api/auth/change-password` - Authenticated password change
  - `GET /api/auth/profile` - User profile retrieval

### 2. Role-Based Access Control System
- **Granular permission system**:
  - Campaign permissions (create, read, update, delete, execute)
  - Contact permissions (create, read, update, delete, import)
  - Message permissions (read, send, reply)
  - Lead permissions (create, read, update, delete, assign)
  - Analytics permissions (read, export)
  - System permissions (user management, settings, automation)

- **Role definitions**:
  - **ADMIN**: Full access to all features
  - **EMPLOYEE**: Limited access (messages, leads, basic dashboard)

- **Route protection middleware** (`middleware.ts`)
  - Automatic route protection based on user roles
  - Redirects for unauthorized access
  - API endpoint protection with proper error responses

- **Permission utilities** (`lib/permissions.ts`)
  - Permission checking functions
  - Navigation item filtering based on permissions
  - Feature flags for UI components
  - Route validation utilities

### 3. React Components and Hooks
- **PermissionGate component** (`app/components/PermissionGate.tsx`)
  - Conditional rendering based on permissions
  - Role-based content display
  - AdminOnly and EmployeeOnly wrapper components

- **useAuth hook** (`app/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
  - Authentication state management
  - Login/logout functionality
  - Automatic token refresh
  - Authentication checking

- **Updated AdminLayout** (`app/admin/components/AdminLayout.tsx`)
  - Dynamic navigation based on user permissions
  - Real-time authentication checking
  - Proper error handling and loading states

### 4. Database Enhancements
- **Updated User model** (Prisma schema)
  - Added password reset token fields
  - Added last login tracking
  - Enhanced user management capabilities

- **Database seeding** (`prisma/seed.ts`)
  - Demo admin user: `admin@quickloan.com` / `admin123`
  - Demo employee user: `employee@quickloan.com` / `emp123`
  - Sample data for testing

### 5. Security Features
- **Password security**:
  - Strong password requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
  - Secure bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
  - Password reset functionality with tokens

- **Session management**:
  - JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
  - Refresh tokens with 7-day expiration
  - Automatic token refresh every 20 minutes
  - Secure HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens

- **API protection**:
  - All sensitive API routes protected with middleware
  - Proper error handling for unauthorized access
  - Input validation and sanitization

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```env
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="24h"
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN="7d"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Database Setup
1. Run migrations: `npm run db:migrate`
2. Generate Prisma client: `npm run db:generate`
3. Seed database: `npm run db:seed`

## ðŸš€ Usage

### For Developers
```typescript
// Protect API routes
import { withAuthAndPermissions } from '@/lib/middleware/auth'
import { PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/auth'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return withAuthAndPermissions([PERMISSIONS.CAMPAIGN_READ])(request, async (req) => {
    // Your protected route logic here
    // Access user via req.user
  })
}

// Use in components
import PermissionGate from '@/app/components/PermissionGate'
import { PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/auth'

<PermissionGate user={user} permissions={[PERMISSIONS.CAMPAIGN_CREATE]}>
  <CreateCampaignButton />
</PermissionGate>
```

### For Users
- **Admin users** have full access to all features
- **Employee users** can only view/respond to messages and manage leads
- Navigation automatically adjusts based on user permissions
- Unauthorized access attempts redirect to appropriate pages

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations
- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens are signed and verified securely
- Refresh tokens are stored as HTTP-only cookies
- Route-level protection prevents unauthorized access
- Input validation on all authentication endpoints
- Automatic session cleanup on logout

## ðŸ“‹ Demo Credentials
- **Admin**: `admin@quickloan.com` / `admin123`
- **Employee**: `employee@quickloan.com` / `emp123`
